This was the final group project of my bootcamp with Supercode. Other members of the group were Amelie Schmidt, Bianka Franke, Quing Chen and Verena Fentross.

The task was to create a movie database using the MovieDB API. The desktop design was provided via Figma, and we were tasked with making the site responsive by coming up with our own mobile & tablet designs.

Here is a link to the final page hosted on Netlify: https://comforting-bombolone-f53d32.netlify.app 

We used Trello for our project management tool.

The project was built using React.

We created components for the following:
- Header
- Footer
- Movie "cards"
- Filter dropdown

There were two pages:
- Homepage
- Detail page

The detail page shows more information about a particular movie when it is clicked in the homepage. This was achieved using useParams and useEffect.

useEffect and useState was used in order to fetch and show filtered and keyword search results.

The filter dropdown was created from scratch as we wanted it to fit in the design of the rest of the page.
